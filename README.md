# Retention-of-Airtel-Customer-Churning-using-R-Programing-

What is the probability of retention of Airtel customers who are churning?

Objective:
Airtel has customers who call in to cancel their connection for a variety of reasons. Airtel has a team which out calls these churning customers to encourage them to stay on with Airtel. Airtel wants a prioritization mechanism so that it will know who to target first so as to retain them? These divisions and ranking of customers can be done through the use of a variety of features.


Suggested Approach:
  
What we need here is a classification model so as to see what is the probability that a customer who is being out called will be retained and based on this we can compute probabilities for particular call profiles. The data has to be cut in such a way so that it is clear what is the optimum customer profile and what to do in such situations.
